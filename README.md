**Player Logger - By FAXES**

**About**
Ever been in the process of banning someone, but as your typing in the command they leave? Well this just might help you. This simple script saves all people that connect to the server in a log. This logs their; game name, steam hex, game license key and it also adds a timestamp! This is a very basic script but its a great utility for the *non-framework* servers that rely on file banning (Eg; Easy Admin) etc. So hopefully this helps someone :smiley: 

**In the Download**
